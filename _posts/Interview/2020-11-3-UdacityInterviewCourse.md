### What IS Data Science?

Data science combines several disciplines, including statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and computer science. 

    One important piece of advice for your job search is to read data science job   descriptions carefully. This will enable you to apply to jobs you’re already qualified for, or develop specific data skill sets to match the roles you want to pursue. 

### Types of Data Science Jobs

* The Data Analyst: Your job might consist of tasks like pulling data out of SQL databases, becoming an Excel or Tableau master, and producing basic data visualizations and reporting dashboards. You may on occasion analyze the results of an A/B test or take the lead on your company’s Google Analytics account.

* The Data Engineer: Since you’d be (one of) the first data hires, heavy statistics and machine learning expertise is less important than strong software engineering skills. Mentorship opportunities for junior data scientists can be less plentiful at a company looking to leverage rapidly increasing amounts of data.

* The Machine Learning Engineer: Often focus more on producing great data-driven products than they do answering operational questions for a company. There are a number of companies for whom their data (or their data analysis platform) is their product.  This is probably the ideal situation for someone who has a formal mathematics, statistics, or physics background and is hoping to continue down a more academic path.

* The Data Science Generalist: Some of the most important ‘data generalist’ skills are familiarity with tools designed for ‘big data,’ and experience with messy, ‘real-life’ datasets

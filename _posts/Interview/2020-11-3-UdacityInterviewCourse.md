### 1. What IS Data Science?

Data science combines several disciplines, including statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and computer science. 

    One important piece of advice for your job search is to read data science job   descriptions carefully. This will enable you to apply to jobs you’re already qualified for, or develop specific data skill sets to match the roles you want to pursue. 

### 2. Types of Data Science Jobs

* The Data Analyst: Your job might consist of tasks like pulling data out of SQL databases, becoming an Excel or Tableau master, and producing basic data visualizations and reporting dashboards. You may on occasion analyze the results of an A/B test or take the lead on your company’s Google Analytics account.

* The Data Engineer: Since you’d be (one of) the first data hires, heavy statistics and machine learning expertise is less important than strong software engineering skills. Mentorship opportunities for junior data scientists can be less plentiful at a company looking to leverage rapidly increasing amounts of data.

* The Machine Learning Engineer: Often focus more on producing great data-driven products than they do answering operational questions for a company. There are a number of companies for whom their data (or their data analysis platform) is their product.  This is probably the ideal situation for someone who has a formal mathematics, statistics, or physics background and is hoping to continue down a more academic path.

* The Data Science Generalist: The company you’re interviewing for cares about data but probably isn’t a data company. Some of the most important ‘data generalist’ skills are familiarity with tools designed for *big data* and experience with messy, ‘real-life’ datasets.

### 3. Interviews are Conversations

Interview is not exam, ask questions to communicate and approach unknown questions as something you want to solve.

    Be confident.

   

### 4. STAR Method

Example: Describe an example when you had a disagreement with your coworker/manager. Why did it happen? How did you handle it?

*Situation*: "One day before we were going to launch a new feature, a new vulnerability was announced in vendor software we use. Patching the problem adequately meant sliding the already delayed schedule. Another team member and I disagreed about which took precedence, the security patch or the feature release. The marketing department had a lot riding on this deadline.”

*Task*: "We needed to decide which goal to pursue and work together as a team."

*Action*: "We decided to look into the details of each problem together. Clearly the deadline was important, but our users’ data might be at risk if we didn’t patch our system. I was tasked to research the security threat more closely, and I realized it did not apply to our users because none of them used that browser which had the vulnerability. So we could just post a message on our website about the browser."

*Result*: "We were able to release our product feature on time even while taking the time to work together to consider an important issue not everyone agreed with at the time."

### 5. Data Analysis Interview Practice 

*Describe A Project*: this is probably the most important question of the interview where you can examine an interviewee from start to end of a project to see (1). Can they describe the problem clearly; (2). How do they approach to solve the problem; (3). Knowing the tools standard for industry;

### 6. Free Throw Probability
One player with p = 2/3 of making a free throw with two chances or another one with p = 1/2 with three chances. Who is better?

    Clear Explaination matters!
    
### 7. SQL Question
Write SQL query to find the three vehicles with the most horse power that have least 6 cylnders.
|              Cars  |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|      Id       |  Int          |
|      Make     |  Char         |
|      Model    |  Char         |
|     No of Cyl    |  Int       |
|     Horse Power   |  Int       |

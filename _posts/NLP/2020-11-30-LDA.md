“ The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word’s presence is attributable to one of the document’s topics.” — Wikipedia

Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is one of the most common algorithms in topic modelling. LDA was proposed by J. K. Pritchard, M. Stephens and P. Donnelly in 2000 and rediscovered by David M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng and Michael I. Jordan in 2003.

How to use WHERE to filter records. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.*/

SELECT NAME 
FROM   world 
WHERE  population >= 200000000 

/*Per capita GDP
3.
Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.*/

SELECT NAME, 
       gdp / population 
FROM   world 
WHERE  population >= 200000000 

/*South America In millions
4.
Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.*/

Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area or big by population but not both. Show name, population and area.

Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included.
Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included.
China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded.

For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.*/

/*Matching name and capital
12.
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.

13.
Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.

Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.

You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'*/

In August 2020, I received my doctoral degree from [Department of Mathematics at University of Maryland](http://www.math.umd.edu/). Prior to that, I got my Master's degree in Mathematics at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/) and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Currently, I am looking for jobs in both academia and industry.

Besides work, I love food, reading, and camping.

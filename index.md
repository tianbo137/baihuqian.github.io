In August 2020, I received my doctoral degree from [Department of Mathematics at University of Maryland](http://www.math.umd.edu/). Prior to that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Currently, I am looking for jobs in both academia and industry, focusing on Machine Learning and Data Scientist positions. 

Besides work, I love food, reading, and camping.

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful.

In August 21 2020, I received my doctoral degree from [Department of Mathematics at University of Maryland](http://www.math.umd.edu/). Prior to that, I received my Master's degree at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/) and Bachelor's degree at [Chu Kezhen Honors College, Zhejiang University](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/main.psp).

Currently, I am looking for jobs in both academia and industry.

Besides work, I love food, reading, and camping.
